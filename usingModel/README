			Script to operate the Wikipedia Model
# =============================================================================== #

Main goal of this script is to cycle through a list of twitter users with their 
corresponding name and description and determine their main interests. 
The interests (or themes) are defined in a seperate text file and the similarity of each word
in the user's name and description for every theme is determined.

Main Inputs:
1) A trained Word2Vec model
2) A trained phrase colocation model (trained to find bigrams)
3) A .txt file that has a list of all the themes that need to be investigated
4) A folder with CSVs, where each CSV represents a tribe that has a list of users, screennames and their 
descriptions. 

Outputs:
1) Folder for each tribe that contains affinity of user's name and description for every theme. 
2) 2 correpsonding CSVs for each tribe that contain information

 - Classification of each user as an individual/corporate/unknown
 - Breakdown of users into clusters for each tribe (cluster represents groups of users that have 
	similarities between each other for certain themes).

Algorithm:

* runAll.sh is a script that will launch 2 main python files;

* Python Script 1) Going through each user in a tribe and assigning a 
similarity score that their name and description have with a select number of themes

* Python Script 2) Combine these scores for each user, 
determine whether they are an individual, corporation or unknown
and assign them to clusters that have overlapping interests.
